                            Hi there! I'm Sophia Bianca, a graphic designer and computer science student. My journey in design began when I was 9 years old. That was when I got my first and only pen tablet that I use 'til today and my first experience in using Photoshop. It was a reward from my mother for my academic performance and because she saw me draw on MS Paint using only a mouse and saw potential. That drawing was Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls which you can see on this page. 
        
                            <br><br>Moving on, I also took interest in video editing in Windows Movie Maker and Animating in Pivot Animator. I also made some games in MS Powerpoint using its animation features, transitions, and hyperlinks. I tried using GameMaker in 2014, I think it was version 8.1, but I only followed specific tutorials and did not develop my own games.
        
                            <br><br>I started formally learning about these in junior high school. Photoshop and photography in 8th grade, animation and VEX IQ robotics in 9th, and a bit of MIT's App Inventor and Visual Basic in 10th grade. I have joined some contests and events since then, that will be listed below. Continuing with my tech journey, I graduated with high honors in senior high school under the strand of ICT. Now pursuing a computer science degree, I plan on further improving my skills and possibly develop new ones.
