                            Since it is a sub-group of a larger community, I integrated the main BCBP logo in the 'o' of "youth". The colors complement our motto which is "From the rising of the sun to its setting, praised be the name of the Lord"
                            the latter part of the motto is translated into Latin "Laudabile nomen Domini".

                            <p>Made in 2019. This is a work of image manipulation. I took parts of many different photos to make the forest. I got fur images and morphed them into the shape of Totoro, took an image of a cat's eyes and nose and a bear's claws and made them his own. I drew on some more fur and whiskers as well as his markings to make it look better. To complete the work was of course, was color grading.</p>

                                    Back to Normal was part of my OJT project in senior high school. The whole project consists of a website, an animation, and an intercative informational "game" about Covid19. My main role in this project was to be the team leader. Aside from leading the group, I also took part in the whole process of the project development especially in animation.

                                    Anqua was also one of my team projects in senior high school for our animation class. It is a game made in Adobe Animate and uses ActionScript 3. The goal in this game is to reach the finish line without bumping into the obstacles. This features increasing speeds as the game progresses.

                                        Using Adobe After Effects, I made our static game-card-styled work into an animated 3D deck.
